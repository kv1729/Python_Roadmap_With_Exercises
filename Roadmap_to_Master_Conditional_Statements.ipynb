    "### 1. **Introduction to Conditional Statements**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Conditional statements enable a program to execute different actions based on whether a given condition is true or false.\n",
    "   - **Types**:\n",
    "     - `if` statements\n",
    "     - `else` statements\n",
    "     - `elif` (else if) statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Basic Syntax**\n",
    "   - **Syntax**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if condition:\n",
    "         # execute code block\n",
    "     elif another_condition:\n",
    "         # execute another code block\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         # execute default code block\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Nested Conditional Statements**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Conditional statements inside other conditional statements.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     if condition1:\n",
    "         if condition2:\n",
    "             # code block\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Logical Operators**\n",
    "   - **Operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "   - **Usage**: Combine multiple conditions.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",

    "\n",
    "Error handling is an essential skill in programming that helps you manage exceptions and ensure that your program runs smoothly, even when unexpected issues arise. In Python, the `try` and `except` blocks allow you to catch and handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìö Topics to Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Introduction to Exception Handling**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Exception handling allows you to respond to errors that occur during program execution without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Basic Syntax**\n",
    "   - **Structure**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "     except ExceptionType:\n",
    "         # Code that runs if the exception occurs\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "         print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Catching Multiple Exceptions**\n",
    "   - **Usage**: You can handle multiple exceptions with separate `except` blocks.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "         result = 10 / num\n",
    "     except ValueError:\n",
    "         print(\"That's not a valid number!\")\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError:\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Using `finally`**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The `finally` block runs regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It‚Äôs typically used for cleanup actions.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         file = open('data.txt', 'r')\n",
    "     except FileNotFoundError:\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Raising Exceptions**\n",
    "   - **Usage**: You can raise exceptions intentionally using the `raise` keyword.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def check_age(age):\n",
    "         if age < 18:\n",
    "             raise ValueError(\"Age must be 18 or older.\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Creating Custom Exceptions**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: You can define your own exception classes by inheriting from the `Exception` class.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         raise CustomError(\"This is a custom error!\")\n",
    "     except CustomError as e:\n",

    "6. Write a script that opens a file and prints its content, handling potential file-related exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hard Level Questions**\n",
    "7. Implement a function that reads a list of numbers from a file and calculates their average, handling any potential exceptions.\n",
    "8. Write a program that creates a custom exception for invalid age and raises it if the input age is below 0.\n",
    "9. Create a program that uses a `try-except-else-finally` structure to read user input and print it out, ensuring that cleanup actions are always performed.\n",
    "10. Write a function that handles multiple types of exceptions and logs them to a file.\n",
