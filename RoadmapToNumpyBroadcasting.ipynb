    "### Understanding Broadcasting in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting is a **key concept in NumPy** that allows operations between arrays of different shapes. It eliminates the need for manually reshaping or replicating arrays to perform element-wise operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Broadcasting?**\n",
    "Broadcasting describes how NumPy treats arrays of different shapes during arithmetic or mathematical operations. Instead of requiring that arrays have the exact same shape, NumPy \"stretches\" the smaller array(s) to match the dimensions of the larger array when the shapes are **compatible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Does Broadcasting Work?**\n",
    "Broadcasting works by following these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compare Shapes**: Starting from the rightmost dimensions, compare the shapes of the two arrays.\n",
    "2. **Compatible Dimensions**:\n",
    "   - Dimensions are compatible if they are **equal** or if one of them is **1**.\n",
    "3. **Stretching**:\n",
    "   - If a dimension is **1**, it is stretched (replicated) to match the other dimension.\n",
    "4. **Error**:\n",
    "   - If the dimensions do not match and are not compatible, NumPy raises a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples of Broadcasting**\n",
    "#### **1. Scalar and Array**\n",
    "A scalar is stretched to match the shape of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # Shape (3,)\n",
    "b = 5                    # Scalar\n",
    "\n",
    "result = a + b\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: [6 7 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Vector and Matrix**\n",
    "A 1D array (vector) can be stretched to match a 2D array (matrix).\n",

    "a = np.array([1, 2, 3])            # Shape (3,)\n",
    "b = np.array([[10], [20], [30]])   # Shape (3, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = a + b  # Broadcasting\n",

    "a = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # Shape (3,)\n",
    "b = np.array([10, 20])   # Shape (2,)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add new dimensions to make shapes compatible\n",

    "#### **1. Data Normalization**\n",
    "Broadcasting simplifies normalizing datasets, such as subtracting the mean or dividing by the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])  # Shape (2, 3)\n",
    "mean = data.mean(axis=0)                 # Shape (3,)\n",
    "normalized = data - mean                 # Broadcasting\n",
    "print(normalized)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Image Processing**\n",
    "In image processing, broadcasting is used to apply transformations to entire images, such as adjusting brightness or applying filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "image = np.ones((100, 100, 3))  # Shape (100, 100, 3)\n",
    "brightness = np.array([0.9, 0.8, 1.2])  # Adjust RGB channels\n",
    "\n",
    "adjusted_image = image * brightness  # Broadcasting scales each channel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Neural Networks**\n",
    "In neural networks, broadcasting is used for operations like:\n",
    "- Adding biases to activations.\n",

    "biases = np.array([0.5, 0.3])                # Shape (2,)\n",
