    "# Python OOP Learning Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Introduction to OOP**\n",
    "   ### What is OOP?\n",
    "   - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods).\n",
    "   - In OOP, **classes** act as blueprints for objects, allowing for reusability and organization.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ### Key Concepts:\n",
    "   1. **Classes and Objects**:\n",
    "      - A class defines a blueprint for creating objects (instances). Each object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "      - **Attributes**: Data or variables inside a class (e.g., `name`, `age`).\n",
    "      - **Methods**: Functions that belong to the class (e.g., `drive()`, `start()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      class Car:\n",
    "          def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "              self.brand = brand\n",
    "              self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "          def start(self):\n",
    "              print(f\"{self.brand} {self.model} is starting...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "      my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "      my_car.start()  # Output: Toyota Corolla is starting...\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "      - **Encapsulation** is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class.\n",
    "      - You can hide internal data using private attributes (prefix `_` or `__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "      - **Abstraction** means hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts.\n",
    "      - Example: A car class can abstract the details of how the engine works and provide a simple `start()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. **Polymorphism**:\n",
    "      - **Polymorphism** allows the same method to operate on different types of objects.\n",
    "      - Example: A `drive()` method can work for both a `Car` and a `Bike`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. **Inheritance**:\n",
    "      - **Inheritance** allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù **Practice Exercise: Introduction to OOP**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Easy:\n",
    "1. Create a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`. Add a method `introduce()` that prints \"Hi, my name is X and I'm Y years old.\"\n",
    "2. Create a class `Dog` with attributes `breed`, `age`, and `name`. Add a method `bark()` that prints \"<name> barks!\"\n",
    "3. Create a `Laptop` class with attributes `brand` and `price`. Add a method `apply_discount` that reduces the price by a given percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Medium:\n",
    "1. Create a `BankAccount` class with methods to deposit, withdraw, and display balance. Ensure users can't withdraw more than the balance.\n",
    "2. Create a `Book` class with attributes like title, author, and publication year. Implement a method to display book details.\n",
    "3. Create a `Library` class that keeps track of available books and allows users to borrow/return books. Add methods to display borrowed and available books.\n",
    "4. Implement a class `Student` with methods to calculate the average grade of multiple subjects and display the final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard:\n",
    "1. Create a `Shape` class and subclasses `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Square`. Each subclass should implement a method to calculate area.\n",
    "2. Design a `ShoppingCart` class that allows users to add and remove items. Track total price and apply discounts for certain conditions.\n",
    "3. Create a `FlightBooking` system where customers can book, modify, or cancel reservations. Implement necessary constraints (e.g., no overbooking).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Dunder (Magic) Methods**\n",
    "### What are Dunder Methods?\n",
    "   - **Dunder methods** (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods that Python uses to provide object-specific behavior, such as initialization, representation, or operator overloading.\n",
    "   - Examples include `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__add__`, and `__eq__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Dunder Methods:\n",
    "1. **`__init__`**:\n",
    "   - This method is called when an object is initialized.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Person:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "             self.name = name\n",
    "             self.age = age\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`__str__` and `__repr__`**:\n",
    "   - **`__str__`**: Defines how an object is presented to end users (friendly representation).\n",
    "   - **`__repr__`**: Developer-friendly representation used for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Person:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "             self.name = name\n",
    "             self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "         def __str__(self):\n",
    "             return f\"{self.name}, Age: {self.age}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "         def __repr__(self):\n",
    "             return f\"Person('{self.name}', {self.age})\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`__eq__`** (Equality Operator Overloading):\n",
    "   - Customizes the behavior of `==` to compare objects.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Book:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, title, author):\n",
    "             self.title = title\n",
    "             self.author = author\n",
    "\n",
    "         def __eq__(self, other):\n",
    "             return self.title == other.title and self.author == other.author\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`__add__`** (Operator Overloading):\n",
    "   - Customizes the behavior of the `+` operator.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Vector:\n",
    "         def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "             self.x = x\n",
    "             self.y = y\n",
    "\n",
    "         def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "             return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù **Practice Exercise: Dunder Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Easy:\n",
    "1. Modify the `Car` class to include `__str__` so that printing a car shows the brand and model.\n",
    "2. Implement `__repr__` for the `Person` class to return a string that can recreate the object.\n",
    "3. Create a class `Point(x, y)` and override `__str__` to display the point as `(x, y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Medium:\n",
    "1. Create a class `Rectangle` with attributes `width` and `height`. Override the `__eq__` method to check if two rectangles have the same area.\n",
    "2. Implement a `Fraction` class with attributes `numerator` and `denominator`. Override `__add__`, `__sub__`, and `__mul__` to support fraction arithmetic.\n",
    "3. Create a class `Time` (hours and minutes). Overload `+` operator to add two `Time` objects, returning the total time.\n",
    "4. Implement a class `Movie` with attributes like title, director, and rating. Override `__eq__` to compare movies by title and rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard:\n",
    "1. Create a class `Polynomial` for representing polynomials. Overload the `+` and `-` operators to add and subtract polynomials.\n",
    "2. Design a `Vector3D` class with x, y, and z coordinates. Override the `__mul__` method to support dot products.\n",
    "3. Implement a `ComplexNumber` class and overload the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators for complex number arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Inheritance in Python**\n",
    "### What is Inheritance?\n",
    "   - **Inheritance** allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class, promoting code reuse and structure.\n",
    "   - **`super()`**: Used to call methods from a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           print(f\"{self.name} makes a sound.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "       def speak(self):\n",
    "           print(f\"{self.name} barks.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Inheritance:\n",
    "   1. **Single Inheritance**: One class inherits from another.\n",
    "   2. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a class that inherits from another class.\n",
    "   3. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù **Practice Exercise: Inheritance**\n",

    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: Design a `SmartDevice` class with methods to connect to Wi-Fi. Create two subclasses `Phone` and `Laptop` that inherit from both `SmartDevice` and another base class `Gadget`, which has methods like `turn_on()` and `turn_off()`. Demonstrate the behavior of each subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a class hierarchy where `Animal` -> `Mammal` -> `Dog`, and a separate class `Robot`. Create a hybrid class `CyborgDog` that inherits from both `Dog` and `Robot`. Make sure both the mammalian and robotic behaviors are incorporated (e.g., `bark()` from `Dog` and `charge()` from `Robot`).\n",

    "## 4. **Decorators**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Decorators?\n",
    "- **Decorators** in Python allow you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without permanently modifying them.\n",
    "- Decorators take a function as an argument, wrap some functionality around it, and return a new function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Common Types of Decorators:\n",
    "1. **Function Decorators**:\n",
    "   - Modify the behavior of functions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def log_decorator(func):\n",
    "       def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "           print(f\"Executing {func.__name__}\")\n",
    "           result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "           print(f\"Finished {func.__name__}\")\n",
    "           return result\n",
    "       return wrapper\n",

    "   # Executing greet\n",
    "   # Hello, Alice!\n",
    "   # Finished greet\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Method Decorators**:\n",
    "   - **`@staticmethod`**: Defines a method that belongs to the class but doesn‚Äôt access class or instance data.\n",
    "   - **`@classmethod`**: Defines a method that accesses class-level data (via `cls`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MathOperations:\n",
    "       @staticmethod\n",
    "       def add(a, b):\n",
    "           return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "       @classmethod\n",
    "       def identity(cls):\n",
    "           return \"I belong to the MathOperations class.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Property Decorator (`@property`)**:\n",
    "   - Allows getter and setter methods to be accessed like attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Circle:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "           self._radius = radius\n",

    "           return self._radius\n",
    "\n",
    "       @radius.setter\n",
    "       def radius(self, value):\n",
    "           if value <= 0:\n",
    "               raise ValueError(\"Radius must be positive.\")\n",

    "1. Implement a `timing_decorator` that calculates and prints the execution time of a function.\n",
    "2. Create a `Circle` class with a private `radius` attribute. Use `@property` and `@setter` decorators to create getter and setter methods for the radius.\n",
    "3. Create a decorator `validate_inputs` that ensures all arguments passed to a function are positive integers.\n",
    "4. Implement a class `TemperatureConverter` with a `@classmethod` that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard:\n",
    "1. Create a decorator `singleton` that ensures a class can only have one instance (i.e., the Singleton pattern).\n",
    "2. Write a class `Cache` that uses a decorator to cache the results of an expensive function call (like Fibonacci calculation).\n",
    "3. Implement a metaclass-based decorator that automatically logs the creation and method calls of objects from classes that use it.\n",

    "## 5. **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Polymorphism?\n",
    "- **Polymorphism** allows methods to operate differently based on the object calling the method.\n",
    "- In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding (same method in different classes) and operator overloading (e.g., customizing `+`, `-`, etc.).\n",

    "## 7. **Advanced OOP Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploring more advanced OOP concepts will further solidify your understanding of how OOP integrates with other Python features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Topics:\n",
    "1. **Metaclasses**:\n",
    "   - **Metaclasses** define how classes behave. They can be used to modify or control class creation.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Meta(type):\n",
    "         def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):\n",
    "             print(f\"Creating class {name}\")\n",
    "             return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)\n",
    "\n",
    "     class MyClass(metaclass=Meta):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstract Base Classes (ABC)**:\n",
    "   - Use **abstract base classes** to define a blueprint for other classes without providing implementation for certain methods.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "         @abstractmethod\n",
    "         def sound(self):\n",
    "             pass\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "         def sound(self):\n",
    "             return \"Bark\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Inheritance** and **MRO** (Method Resolution Order):\n",
    "   - **Multiple inheritance** allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes, but managing conflicts can be tricky.\n",
    "   - **MRO** determines the order in which methods are inherited.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class A:\n",
    "         def do_something(self):\n",
    "             print(\"A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class B(A):\n",
    "         def do_something(self):\n",
    "             print(\"B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class C(A):\n",
    "         def do_something(self):\n",
    "             print(\"C\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class D(B, C):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "\n",
    "     d = D()\n",
    "     d.do_something()  # Output: B (due to MRO)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The `super()` Function**:\n",
    "   - **`super()`** allows you to call methods from a parent class, ensuring that the method resolution follows Python's MRO.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Parent:\n",
    "         def greet(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Hello from Parent\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Child(Parent):\n",
    "         def greet(self):\n",
    "             super().greet()\n",
    "             print(\"Hello from Child\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù **Practice Exercise: Advanced OOP Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Easy:\n",
    "1. Create a class `Robot` with a metaclass that prints a message whenever a new class is created.\n",
    "2. Create an abstract class `Vehicle` with an abstract method `drive()`. Subclass `Car` and `Bike` to implement the method.\n",
    "3. Use `super()` in a class hierarchy `Animal` -> `Mammal` -> `Dog` to call parent methods in sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Medium:\n",
    "1. Create a class `Logger` that uses a metaclass to add a `log()` method to every subclass automatically.\n",
    "2. Create an abstract base class `Shape` with abstract methods `area()` and `perimeter()`. Implement concrete classes `Square`, `Circle`, and `Rectangle`.\n",
    "3. Demonstrate multiple inheritance by creating a `Person` class and mix it with `Worker` and `Student` classes. Ensure the MRO calls each class‚Äôs methods in the correct order.\n",
    "4. Implement a `Device` class hierarchy where each subclass uses `super()` to call parent initialization methods, adding more specific details at each level (e.g., `ElectronicDevice`, `SmartDevice`, `Phone`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hard:\n",
    "1. Implement a `MetaSingleton` metaclass that ensures only one instance of any class created with this metaclass exists.\n",
    "2. Create a class hierarchy for a file system where you have an abstract base class `FileSystemEntity`, and subclasses `File` and `Directory`. The `Directory` should be able to contain multiple `File` or `Directory` objects. Use **abstract base classes** to enforce a method `size()` that returns the size of each file/directory.\n",
    "3. Create a `Vehicle` base class and two subclasses `Car` and `Truck`. Implement a class `HybridCar` that inherits from both `Car` and `Truck`. Override methods in such a way that `HybridCar` uses specific methods from both parent classes (demonstrating multiple inheritance and method overriding).\n",

    "### Closing Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This roadmap provides a comprehensive guide to mastering OOP in Python, covering essential topics like **dunder methods**, **inheritance**, **decorators**, and **polymorphism** with progressively challenging exercises. By following this path and consistently practicing the exercises, you'll develop a solid understanding of both **object-oriented** and **functional programming** paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you move through the topics:\n",
    "- Start with simple class designs and build your way up to more complex interactions involving multiple classes.\n",
    "- Use decorators and functional programming techniques to extend class behaviors without altering class definitions.\n",
    "- Implement **real-world scenarios** (such as banking systems, file management systems, etc.) to apply the concepts practically.\n",
