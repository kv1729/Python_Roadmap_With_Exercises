    "\n",
    "To become proficient in regex, it's important to start with the basics and gradually move towards more advanced patterns and use cases. Below is a **4-week practice plan** designed to help you master regular expressions step by step. Each week includes **theory**, **practice questions**, and **challenges** that cover different aspects of regex.\n",

    "  \n",
    "#### **Practice Exercises:**\n",
    "1. Write a regex pattern to match a valid email address.\n",

    "- Grouping: `()`, `(?:...)`\n",
    "- Alternation: `|` (OR)\n",
    "- Escape Sequences: `\\d`, `\\w`, `\\s`, and their capitalized opposites (e.g., `\\D`, `\\W`)\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Practice Exercises:**\n",
    "1. Write a regex to match words that start and end with the same letter.\n",
    "2. Create a regex to match strings that start with a vowel.\n",
    "3. Match all words in a sentence that are exactly 4 characters long.\n",
    "4. Write a regex to extract file extensions from a list of filenames.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Challenges:**\n",
    "- Match all valid URLs in a block of text.\n",
    "- Extract all words that have at least two consecutive vowels.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Week 3: Advanced Regex** üß†\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Learning Goals:**\n",
    "- Understand regex for more complex matching like lookaheads and lookbehinds.\n",
    "- Learn about greedy vs non-greedy matching.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Topics:**\n",
    "- Lookaheads: `(?=...)`, `(?!...)`\n",
    "- Lookbehinds: `(?<=...)`, `(?<!...)`\n",
    "- Non-Greedy Quantifiers: `*?`, `+?`, `??`, `{n,m}?`\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Practice Exercises:**\n",
    "1. Write a regex to match all instances of a word that are **not** followed by a specific word.\n",
    "2. Extract all words that have at least one uppercase letter but are **not** followed by a digit.\n",
    "3. Match all email addresses where the domain is either \"gmail.com\" or \"yahoo.com\".\n",
    "4. Create a regex to match all sequences of 3 consecutive digits that are not followed by another digit.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Challenges:**\n",
    "- Write a regex to extract all HTML tags, **excluding** comments.\n",
    "- Match all words in a string **not** preceded by a number.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Tips to Succeed** ‚ú®\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test Regularly**: Use an online regex tester like [Regex101](https://regex101.com) to validate and debug your patterns.\n",
    "2. **Break It Down**: When faced with a complex pattern, break it down into smaller, testable parts.\n",
    "3. **Use Comments**: Use the `re.VERBOSE` flag in Python to write regex patterns with comments, improving readability.\n",
    "4. **Practice Consistently**: Practice a few regex problems each day. The more you practice, the more natural it becomes!\n",
